### **Dataset**

Today, we will have a look at the AG's News Topic Classification Dataset. The dataset includes title and description of news articles for 120,000 training samples and 7,600 test samples. Each of those is classified into of the categories "World", "Sports", "Business", or "Sci/Tech" (see [here](https://github.com/mhjabreel/CharCnn_Keras/tree/master/data/ag_news_csv) for more information). Here you can see a random sample of the dataset:

´´´
Class: "Sci/Tech"
Title: "E-mail scam targets police chief",
Description: "Wiltshire Police warns about "phishing" after its fraud squad chief was targeted."
´´´

We will implement a Random Forest classifier to learn this problem and hopefully achieve a good result on the test dataset. Before we get started, download the training data [here](https://patrick-richter.github.io/assets/csv/train.csv) and the test data [here](https://patrick-richter.github.io/assets/csv/test.csv).
