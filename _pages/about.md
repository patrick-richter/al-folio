Hi everyone, this is **Patrick**. When I first got in touch with Machine Learning during my undergraduate degree, I was so captivated that I knew this is the path I want to pursue in my career. So, after interning in an AI-startup, I decided to come to the UK and get a **Data Science Master's degree** here.

Whilst doing coursework or having a go at my own projects, I discovered that it is quite hard to find help online in improving your Machine Learning skills. Therefore, I launched this website where I **showcase my growing collection of projects** and **try to comprehensively explain the underlying algorithms**. 

Have a look at `Machine Learning Projects` to look at some cool projects in the fields of **Classic Machine Learning**, **Deep Learning**, and **Reinforcement Learning**.

Are you interested in getting in touch or do you have any questions regarding the projects? Letâ€™s get connected on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/patrick-richter-24bb961a5/) or check out my [CV]().
