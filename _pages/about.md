Hi everyone, this is **Patrick**. I was so **captivated after first getting in touch with Machine Learning** during my Mechanical Engineering undergrad and while I was doing an internship in an AI-startup, that I knew this is the path I want to pursue in my career. So, I decided to come to the UK and get a **Data Science Master's degree** here.

Whilst doing coursework or having a go at my own projects, I discovered that it is quite hard to find websites that give you an in-depth explanation of how to use different Machine Learning algorithms and how they work in detail. Therefore, I launched this website where I **showcase my growing collection of projects** and **try to comprehensively explain the underlying algorithms**. 

Have a look at `Machine Learning Projects` to look at some cool projects in the fields of **Classic Machine Learning**, **Deep Learning**, and **Reinforcement Learning**.
