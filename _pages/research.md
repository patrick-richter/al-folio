##### **Bachelor's Thesis: "Development of a Data-Driven Battery Aging Model"**

**Abstract:**
Predicting battery aging for lithium-ion batteries is crucial, because of this component's exceptional impact on the overall electric vehicle's durability. Since it often takes months or years to run experiments examining battery aging, battery aging models can safe plenty of development time. Conventional models often find it difficult to depict the complex, nonlinear aging mechanisms. Battery aging models based on Machine Learning have shown promising results. In this work, a data-based Long Short-Term Memory network (LSTM) model is developed, ultilizing a publicly available dataset of 174 lithium-ion batteries. The LSTM's hyperparameters are optimized with a grid search, whereby the best model achieves a mean average error (MAE) of only 0.33 % in predicting the course of the state of health (SOH). It predicts the SOH profile of all validation samples in a 1.3 % MAE margin, with 72 % of the samples in a margin of 0.3 %. By applying the model to a real-life EV charging profile, the work advances into unchartered territory and proposes a model advancement to overcome the problems encountered.
